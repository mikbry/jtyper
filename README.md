> JTyper is your notebook app for coding, data science and machine learning. It runs in your browser using modern javascript. And it is compatible with latest frameworks like Tensorflow.js.

## Why JTyper ?

We are at a crossroad in Web development : Javascript ecosystem is strong (ReactJs, Node.js, ...) and new technologies are rising (Typescript, WASM, WebGPU, Deno). Running heavy computational applications in browser will be soon a really. JTyper is a vision of this future. Where applications will run transparently some processes on a PC, a smartphone, and distribute others to a cluster of servers. 

So we outline some mandatories points:
- No complex installation needed, no VM
- Run in modern browsers using using standard technologies as Javascript and WASM
- Compatible with ipynb files and Jupyter common usages
- Small in size
- Open-source

Going further:
- [Javascript third age](https://www.swyx.io/writing/js-third-age/)
- [The WebAssembly App Gap](https://paulbutler.org/2020/the-webassembly-app-gap/)

## RoadMap

JTyper is experimental and on its first iteration.

### v0.1.0 - [Current version](https://github.com/mikbry/jtyper/projects/1)

### Future versions

- WASM support
- Other maths and AI frameworks (as PyTorch)
- Typescript and more languages support
- Collaboration
- Distributed computing

## Requirements
- Works on modern browsers supporting ES6+ (Not compatible with IE)
